        Aspirin is an effective analgesic (pain reliever), antipyretic (fever reducer) and <br>
        anti-inflammatory agent and is one of the most widely used non-prescription drugs. The <br>
        use of aspirin had its origin in the 18th century, when it was found that an extract from the <br>
        bark of willow trees was useful in reducing pain and fever. The active ingredient in <br>
        willow bark was later found to be salicylic acid. The structure of salicylic acid is shown <br>
        below. Although salicylic acid was effective at reducing pain and fever, it also had some <br>
        unpleasant side effects. It is irritating to the lining of the mouth, esophagus, and stomach, <br>
        and can cause hemorrhaging of the stomach lining. In 1899, the Bayer Company in <br>
        Germany patented a drug they called aspirin, which was a modification of salicylic acid.
