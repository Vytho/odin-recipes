    <p style="text-align: center;">The Haber process, also called the Haber-Bosch process, is the main industrial procedure for the production of ammonia. <br>
        The German chemists Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch developed it in the first decade of the 20th century. The process converts <br>
        atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) by a reaction with hydrogen (H2) using an iron metal catalyst under high <br>
        temperatures and pressures. This reaction is slightly exothermic (i.e. it releases energy), meaning that the reaction <br>
        is favoured at lower temperatures and higher pressures. It decreases entropy, complicating the process. Hydrogen is <br>
        produced via steam reforming, followed by an iterative closed cycle to react hydrogen with nitrogen to produce ammonia.</p>
